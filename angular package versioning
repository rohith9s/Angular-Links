# package.json in Angular

In an Angular project's `package.json` file, you specify the dependencies your project relies on, including Angular itself and various libraries or packages. When you specify a dependency, you also specify its version. Version numbers in `package.json` can use different notation styles to indicate which versions of a package are acceptable. The two most common versioning styles used in `package.json` are:

1. **Exact Version:** You specify the exact version number you want to use. For example:


   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "angular": "12.0.0"
   }
   ```

   In this case, your project will use version 12.0.0 of the "angular" package, and it will not automatically update to newer versions.

2. **Semantic Versioning (Semver):** Semantic versioning is a system for versioning software in a way that indicates compatibility and introduces the following notation styles:

   - `^`: The caret symbol (`^`) in front of a version number allows updates for compatible features (minor and patch versions). For example:

     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "angular": "^12.0.0"
     }
     ```

     In this case, your project will use version 12.0.0 of the "angular" package, but it can automatically update to any version that is compatible, such as 12.1.0 or 12.0.1. The first digit (major version) is considered rigid and not updated automatically.

   - `~`: The tilde symbol (`~`) in front of a version number allows updates for compatible patch versions only. For example:

     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "angular": "~12.0.0"
     }
     ```

     In this case, your project will use version 12.0.0 of the "angular" package and can automatically update to versions like 12.0.1 or 12.0.2, but it will not update to version 12.1.0 or any other minor or major version.

   Semantic versioning follows the pattern `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:

   - `MAJOR` version changes indicate backward-incompatible changes. Updates here may require adjustments to your code.
   - `MINOR` version changes indicate backward-compatible additions or changes. Updates are expected to be safe.
   - `PATCH` version changes indicate backward-compatible bug fixes or improvements. Updates should be safe.

These notations help you define how strictly you want to control the versions of your project's dependencies. The choice between exact version, `^`, or `~` depends on your project's requirements and how willing you are to adopt new features and bug fixes in your dependencies.
